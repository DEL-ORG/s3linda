In this example, I've defined two services, 'webapp' and 'database,' each encapsulating a specific component of the application. The 'webapp' service relies on the 'database' service, ensuring a proper startup order. I've also employed a custom bridge network ('my_network') to facilitate communication between containers.

In short:

Git is the tool, GitHub is the platform.
Git is for managing versions, GitHub is for hosting and collaborating.
You can use Git without GitHub, but you can't use GitHub without Git.
Here's an analogy:

Think of Git as a personal notebook where you track changes to your code.
Think of GitHub as a public library where you can store your notebooks, share them with others, and collaborate on them together.
