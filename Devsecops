The difference between a DevOps engineer and a DevSecOps engineer lies in their areas of focus and responsibilities within the software development and operations process.

A DevOps engineer primarily focuses on the collaboration and integration between development and operations teams to streamline the software delivery process. They work to automate and optimize the development, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes to ensure faster and more reliable software releases. Their goal is to enable continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and efficient collaboration between teams.

On the other hand, a DevSecOps engineer, as the name suggests, adds an additional focus on security to the DevOps practices. They aim to integrate security practices and considerations throughout the entire software development lifecycle. DevSecOps engineers work to embed security into the development process from the start, ensuring that security measures are implemented at every stage, including design, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
